# Moon Elevation Demo

This is a demo to visualize the elevation of the moon.
I am not a moon expert, so I am not sure if I am really visualizing the correct elevation.
If there is a problem, please let me know via issue.

## Feature

- Generate 3D geometry from geotiff
- Visualization of Moon Elevation with shader
